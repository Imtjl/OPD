# Welcome to the OPD Repository!

The OPD (Our Programming on assembly Journey) repository is a place for us to store and share our programming resources among all of the students. 
Here, you'll find a collection of laboratory works, tutorials, and useful documents that we've created over time.

### Repository Content:
- `Laboratory Works`: This repo contains all our laboratory works sorted by number.
- `Tutorials`: You can also find some step-by-step guides, tutorials, and walkthroughs that we've created to help us learn assembly programming and other skills.
- `docs`: This folder is a collection of useful documents, cheat sheets, and other materials that we've found helpful in our programming journey.
